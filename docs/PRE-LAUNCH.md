## Apply order tomorrow morning

When you wake up, the deploy sequence is:

1. **Take a Supabase backup.** Dashboard → Database → Backups → "Create backup now". Skip only if you accept the risk.

2. **Apply migration 002.** Open SQL editor, paste `migrations/002_phase0_security_hardening.sql` in one go, run. Confirm every line in the output starts with `✓`. If anything fails, the transaction rolls back — fix and retry.

3. **Verify migration 002 didn't break anything.** Hit the production URL, log in as a regular user, browse trips, send a message. ~5 minutes.

4. **Apply migration 003.** Paste `migrations/003_phase1_atomic_rpcs.sql`. Confirm `✓` on book_seat and delete_user_account_v2. After this, the RPC path in `src/pages/TripDetails.jsx` activates automatically — book a test trip and confirm the booking lands.

5. **Optional: apply migration 004.** Storage hardening. Confirm test license uploads still work afterward — the upload code now writes UUID-prefixed paths so it should be fine.

6. **Run the C-01 exploit confirm.** Open browser dev console as a regular user, attempt:
   ```javascript
   fetch(`${SUPABASE_URL}/rest/v1/profiles?id=eq.${MY_UUID}`, {
     method: 'PATCH',
     headers: { apikey: ANON, Authorization: `Bearer ${TOKEN}`, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({ role: 'admin' })
   }).then(r => r.text()).then(console.log)
   ```
   Expected: `42501` / "modifying role requires admin". If that returns success, the migration didn't apply correctly.

7. **Enable hCaptcha.** Supabase Dashboard → Auth → enable Captcha protection. ~2 minutes.

8. **Confirm realtime publication includes messages + notifications.** SQL Editor → run:
   ```sql
   SELECT pubname, schemaname, tablename
   FROM pg_publication_tables
   WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
   ```
   Should list `messages` and `notifications`. If not, run:
   ```sql
   ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.messages;
   ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.notifications;
   ```

That's everything that's deployable from the work in this repo. The remaining items in the table above need a human in the loop — lawyer for privacy policy, decision on Twilio for SMS verification, etc.
